# server-check

A bash script written to gather data about a server. Using sysstat (sar reports),
it aims to provide average memory and cpu usage for a device as well as other
relevant details about the server.

Originally written by Sam Sharpe ( https://github.com/samjsharpe ) He has asked 
that this be dedicated to "all the Rackers past and present whose ideas I probably 
stole while making the original script." A dedication I heartily second as someone
that cobbles together one liners when I see cool stuff other people are doing. ;)

Currently supports Redhat variants (ES, CentOS, Fedora) and Debian/Ubuntu.

Others may be added at a future date.

Usage: /path/to/binary/server-check
